## Office Hours
By appointment. Email is the preferred method of contact. Meetings will be held over Zoom.
 
## Course Summary
Management and analysis of complicated datasets such as those in molecular evolution, systematics, and genomics. Demonstrations, exercises, and student projects to teach advanced Unix skills, programming (e.g. Python and R), and data management. No textbook is required.
 
## Learning Outcomes
At the end of the course, students will understand basic programming skills for bash/shell, R, and Python. In particular, students will be expected to understand basic computer terminology, when to use a number of different bioinformatics techniques, how to write a range of programs, and how to organize and analyze large datasets. They will also be expected to appreciate the importance of bioinformatics techniques with respect to a broad swath of biological disciplines, including the health sciences, ecology, evolution, development, and molecular biology.
 
## Computer Requirements
This course will be held in a computer room where students will have access to a computer and the UI computer cluster. Outside of class hours students will be expected to compete assignments and projects, which will also require access to a computer. If you do not have access to a computer outside of the classroom, please consider filling out a request and checking out a laptop through the Vandal Laptop Checkout Program [https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/services/laptop-checkout-program](https://www.uidaho.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/services/laptop-checkout-program) or by accessing a computer though the UIdaho Library.
 
## Grading
Grades will be based on 12 weekly quizzes and 2 larger assignments (a midterm and a final). Each large assignment will be worth 100 points. Weekly Quiz will be worth 10 points each. The total number of points available is 320. Letter grades will be determined by the percentage of points earned by a student, as follows: 0-60% = F, 60-69% = D, 70-79% = C, 80-89% = B, 90-100% = A.
 
## Attendance
Even though this course is technically in-person, students have the option of meeting in person or participating via Zoom during the scheduled class time. The expectation is that all students will be available either in person or by Zoom during class. Students who cannot be present (or connected via Zoom) should contact the instructor. Check Canvas for the Zoom meeting link, Zoom ID, and passcode.
 
Many class periods will have an assignment that must be completed during class. These will not be announced ahead of time. Unexcused absences will result in a 0 on the assignment for the day. Students will be permitted to make up missed work, provided they can document the absence as an official university-excused absence. The intent to make up a missed assignment must be communicated to the instructor within three days of the absence for the student to be eligible for a makeup assignment.
 
### Covid-19 considerations
The University of Idaho is still operating under Covid-19 precautions. In class, students are required to wear face coverings at all times. Students experiencing any symptoms consistent with Covid-19, including sore throat, cough, fever, etc., should attend class via Zoom rather than in person. In fact, students feeling less than 100% healthy should take advantage of Zoom – attending via Zoom will not affect anyone’s grade in a negative way. Any student is welcome to opt to attend via Zoom for any reason and instructor permission is not required.
 
## Center for disability access and resources reasonable accommodations statement

All accommodations must be approved through the Center for Disability Access and Resources located in the Bruce M.
