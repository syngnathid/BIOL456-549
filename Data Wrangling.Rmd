## Overview

- ~~Part 1 - R and Rstudio as a tool for Computational Biology.~~ 
- **Part 2 - Data Wrangling using `tidyr` and `dplyr`**
- Activity and Quiz

## Recap - Part 1 - R as a tool for Computational Biology {data-transition="zoom"}

- Why R and Rstudio?
- Basics.  
  - Operations (Addition, Subtraction, etc.).  
  - Operators. (Logical Operators `>`,`<`,`>=`,`<=`,`==`,`!=`) 
- Variables and DataTypes
  - Variable/Single Element Objects
    - Datatype - Character
    - Datatype - Numeric
    - Datatype - Logical
  - Vectors
    - Collection of elements of *same datatype*.

## Objective of Today's Class

- Be able to work with tabular data.
- Understand and apply `pipes (%>%)` in `tidyverse` to `filter()`
- Be able to use logical operators to subset operation using various functions (`select()`, `filter()` and `mutate()`).


## Overview of Today's class

- Core Principles of Data Wrangling and Manipulation.  
- 7 Functions to manipulate the dataset.
  - `glimpse()`
  - `select()`
  - `filter()`
  - `group_by()`
  - `summarize()`
  - `mutate()`
  - `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`
- Exercises 

## Core Principles of Data Wrangling and Manipulation

1. Keep raw data separate from analyzed data.  
2. Keep spreadsheet data Tidy.  
  2a. One row in our spreadsheet for each observation or sample, and One column for every variable that we measure or report on.  
3. Trust but verify.

- Type your username and password to login.
  - Your username is same as the one you use to `ssh`.  
  
## `group_by()`
